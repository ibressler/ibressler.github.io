My name is Ingo Bre√üler. As an experienced computer engineer, I design and implement solutions for technical challenges in various application areas.

I combine suitable technologies and methods from software and hardware and optimize them for their purpose and area of application.

This includes, for example:
| | |    |
|-|-| :- |
|{{< icon geometry >}}|&nbsp;| **Computer-controlled 3D cutting machines** that cut out freely designed three-dimensional shapes from a block of foam; these are used by industrial designers and architects |
|{{< icon machine >}} |      | Control and **data preparation for a 3D ceramic printer** with a rotating printing bed as external consulting for the prototype development of a start-up company |
|{{< icon analysis >}}|      | **Development of algorithms** for the comparison of measurement data with theoretical models in science |
|{{< icon optim >}}   |      | **Digitalization** in the chemistry laboratory to record data and information from experiments and processes as automatically as possible, to archive this data in a structured and machine-readable format and to use it later as a starting point for further analyses. |

Do you have similar exciting projects and need technical support with planning and implementation? [Feel free to contact me]({{% relref path="/#contact" lang="en" %}}) for a non-binding half-hour initial consultation and tell me about your project!
