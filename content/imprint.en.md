### Liability for contents

All contents of my website have been created with the utmost care and to the best of my knowledge. However, I cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the content. As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on these pages in accordance with the general laws pursuant to § 7 Para. 1 (german) TMG. According to §§ 8 to 10 (german) TMG, however, I am not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under the general laws remain unaffected.

However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If I become aware of the above-mentioned infringements, I will remove this content immediately.

### Limitation of liability for external links

My website contains links to external third-party websites. I have no influence on the content of these directly or indirectly linked websites. Therefore, I cannot assume any liability for the accuracy of the contents of the "external links". The respective providers or operators (authors) of the sites are responsible for the contents of the external links.

The external links were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking and were free of illegal content at the time of linking. A constant review of the contents of the external links is not possible without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. In the case of direct or indirect links to the websites of third parties that lie outside my area of responsibility, a liability obligation would only exist in the case where I become aware of the content and it would be technically possible and reasonable for me to prevent use in the case of illegal content.

This disclaimer also applies to links and references within my own website "{{< siteurl >}}" from questioners, bloggers, guests of the discussion forum. For illegal, incorrect or incomplete contents and in particular for damage, which develops from the use or disuse of such presented information, alone the service provider of the side, to which one referred, is responsible in particular that, which refers over left to the respective publication only.

If I become aware of any legal violations, I will remove the external links immediately.
