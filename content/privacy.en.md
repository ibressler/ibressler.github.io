### Applicable legal basis {#m13}

The following is an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on the basis of which I process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or my country of residence or domicile. Furthermore, should more specific legal bases be decisive in individual cases, I will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.

- **Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a) GDPR)** - The affected person has given their consent to the processing of their personal data for a specific purpose or several specific purposes.
- **Contract performance and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b. GDPR)** - The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the affected person is a party or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the request of the affected person.
- **Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b. GDPR)** - The processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the responsible person or of a third party, unless such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data.

**National data protection regulations in Germany:** In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. These include, in particular, the Act on the Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. The data protection laws of the individual federal states may also apply.

**Note on the applicability of the GDPR and Swiss DPA:** This data protection notice serves to provide information in accordance with both the Swiss DPA and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, please note that the terms of the GDPR are used due to the broader geographical application and comprehensibility. The legal meaning of the terms will continue to be determined in accordance with the Swiss DPA within the scope of application of the Swiss DPA.

## Security measures {#m27}

I take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.

The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access, input, disclosure, ensuring availability and separation of the data. Furthermore, I have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data and responses to data breaches. Furthermore, I already take the protection of personal data into account during the development or selection of hardware, software and procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.

Securing online connections using TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect user data transmitted via my online services from unauthorized access, I use TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the Internet. These technologies encrypt the information transmitted between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), protecting the data from unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transmissions meet the highest security standards. If a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate, this is signaled by the display of HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator to users that their data is being transmitted securely and encrypted.

## Transmission of personal data {#m25}

As part of my processing of personal data, it may be transmitted to other bodies, companies, legally independent organizational units or persons or disclosed to them. The recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, I observe the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude corresponding contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data that serve to protect your data.

## Data processing in third countries {#m24}

If I process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if the processing takes place in the context of the use of third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, bodies or companies, this will only take place in accordance with the legal requirements. If the level of data protection in the third country has been recognized by means of an adequacy decision (Art. 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for the data transfer. Otherwise, data will only be transferred if the level of data protection is otherwise ensured, in particular through standard contractual clauses (Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c) GDPR), express consent or in the case of contractual or legally required transfer (Art. 49 para. 1 GDPR). In addition, I will inform you of the basis for third country transfers with the individual providers from the third country, whereby the adequacy decisions take precedence as the basis. Information on third country transfers and existing adequacy decisions can be found in the information provided by the EU Commission: <https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=en>. As part of the so-called “Data Privacy Framework” (DPF), the EU Commission has also assessed the level of data protection for certain companies from the USA as part of the adequacy decision of 10.07.2023. The list of certified companies and further information on the DPF can be found on the website of the US Department of Commerce at <https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov>. As part of the data protection information, I will inform you which service providers I use are certified under the Data Privacy Framework.

## General information on data storage and deletion {#m12}

I delete personal data that I process in accordance with the statutory provisions as soon as the underlying consents are revoked or there is no further legal basis for the processing. This applies to cases in which the original purpose of processing no longer applies or the data is no longer required. There are exceptions to this rule if legal obligations or special interests require longer storage or archiving of the data.

In particular, data that must be stored for commercial or tax law reasons or whose storage is necessary for legal prosecution or to protect the rights of other natural or legal persons must be archived accordingly.

My data protection information contains additional information on the retention and deletion of data that applies specifically to certain processing operations.

If there is more than one indication of the retention period or deletion period for a date, the longest period shall always apply.

If a period does not expressly begin on a specific date and is at least one year, it automatically starts at the end of the calendar year in which the event triggering the period occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in the context of which data is stored, the event triggering the deadline is the date on which the termination or other termination of the legal relationship takes effect.

Data that is no longer stored for the originally intended purpose, but due to legal requirements or other reasons, will only be processed for the reasons that justify its storage.

**Further notes on processing operations, procedures and services:**

- **Retention and deletion of data:** The following general periods apply to retention and archiving under German law:
  - 10 years: retention period for books and records, annual financial statements, inventories, management reports, opening balance sheet as well as the work instructions and other organizational documents required for their understanding (§ 147 para. 1 no. 1 in conjunction with. Para. 3 AO, § 14b Para. 1 UStG, § 257 Para. 1 No. 1 i.V.m. para. 4 HGB).
  - 8 years: Accounting documents, such as invoices and expense receipts (§ 147 para. 1 no. 4 and 4a in conjunction with para. para. 3 sentence 1 AO and § 257 para. 1 no. 4 in conjunction with para. para. 4 HGB).
  - 6 years: Other business documents: received commercial or business letters, reproductions of sent commercial or business letters, other documents, insofar as they are relevant for taxation, e.g. time sheets, company accounting sheets, calculation documents, price markings, but also payroll accounting documents, insofar as they are not already accounting documents and cash register strips (Section 147 (1) nos. 2, 3, 5 in conjunction with (3) AO, Section 257 (1) no. 4 in conjunction with (3) AO and Section 257 (1) no. 4 in conjunction with (4) HGB). Para. 3 AO, § 257 Para. 1 No. 2 and 3 in conjunction with Para. para. 4 HGB).
  - 3 years: Data required to consider potential warranty and compensation claims or similar contractual claims and rights and to process related inquiries based on past business experience and standard industry practices will be stored for the duration of the regular statutory limitation period of three years (§§ 195, 199 BGB).

## Business processes and procedures {#m221}

Personal data of service recipients and clients - including customers, clients or, in special cases, clients, patients or business partners as well as other third parties - are processed within the scope of contractual and comparable legal relationships and pre-contractual measures such as the initiation of business relationships. This data processing supports and facilitates business processes in areas such as customer management, sales, payment transactions, accounting and project management.

The data collected is used to fulfill contractual obligations and efficiently design operational processes. This includes the processing of business transactions, the management of customer relationships, the optimization of sales strategies and the guarantee of internal accounting and financial processes.

**Further notes on processing operations, procedures and services:**

- **Economic analyses and market research:** In order to fulfill business purposes and to identify market trends, wishes of contractual partners and users, the available data on business transactions, contracts, inquiries, etc. are analyzed. The group of data subjects may include contractual partners, interested parties, customers, visitors and users of the responsible person's online offering. The analyses are carried out for the purposes of business evaluations, marketing and market research (e.g. to determine customer groups with different characteristics). If available, profiles of registered users and their details of services used are taken into account. The analyses are used exclusively by the responsible person and are not disclosed externally, unless they are anonymous analyses with summarized, i.e. anonymized values. In addition, the privacy of the users is taken into account; the data is pseudonymized as far as possible for analysis purposes and, if feasible, processed anonymously (e.g. as aggregated data); legal basis: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).

## Payment methods {#m222}

As part of contractual and other legal relationships, due to legal obligations or otherwise on the basis of my legitimate interests, I offer the data subjects efficient and secure payment options and use other service providers in addition to banks and credit institutions (collectively referred to as “payment service providers”).

The data processed by the payment service providers includes inventory data, such as the name and address, bank data, such as account numbers or credit card numbers, passwords, TANs and checksums, as well as contract, total and recipient-related information. The information is required to carry out the transactions. However, the data entered is only processed by the payment service providers and stored by them. This means that I do not receive any account or credit card-related information, but only information with confirmation or negative information about the payment. Under certain circumstances, the data may be transmitted by the payment service providers to credit agencies. The purpose of this transmission is to check identity and creditworthiness. Please refer to the payment service providers' terms and conditions and data protection information.

Payment transactions are subject to the terms and conditions and the data protection notices of the respective payment service providers, which are available on the respective websites or transaction applications. I also refer to these for further information and the assertion of rights of revocation, information and other rights of data subjects.

- **Processed data types:** Inventory data (e.g. full name, residential address, contact information, customer number, etc.); payment data (e.g. bank details, invoices, payment history); contract data (e.g. subject matter of the contract, duration, customer category); usage data (e.g. page views and length of stay, click paths, intensity and frequency of use, device types and operating systems used, interactions with content and functions).

## Communication via Messenger {#m391}

I use messengers for communication purposes and therefore ask you to observe the following information on the functionality of the messengers, encryption, the use of communication metadata and your options to object.

You can also contact me by alternative means, e.g. by telephone or email. Please use the contact options provided to you or the contact options provided within my online offering.

In the case of end-to-end encryption of content (i.e. the content of your message and attachments), I would like to point out that the communication content (i.e. the content of the message and attached images) is encrypted from end to end. This means that the content of the messages cannot be viewed, not even by the messenger providers themselves. You should always use an up-to-date version of the messenger with encryption activated to ensure that the message content is encrypted.

However, I also point out to my communication partners that although the messenger providers cannot view the content, they can find out that and when communication partners communicate with me and that technical information about the device used by the communication partners and, depending on the settings of their device, location information (so-called metadata) is also processed.

**Notes on legal bases:** If I ask communication partners for permission before communicating with them via Messenger, the legal basis for my processing of their data is their consent. Otherwise, if I do not ask for consent and they contact me on their own initiative, for example, I use Messenger in relation to my contractual partners and in the context of contract initiation as a contractual measure and, in the case of other interested parties and communication partners, on the basis of my legitimate interests in fast and efficient communication and meeting the needs of my communication partners in communication via Messenger. I would also like to point out that I will not transmit the contact data provided to me to the messengers for the first time without your consent.

**Revocation, objection and deletion:** You can revoke your consent at any time.

- **Processed data types:** Contact data (e.g. postal and e-mail addresses or telephone numbers), content data (e.g. textual or pictorial messages and contributions as well as the information relating to them, such as information on authorship).
- **Affected persons:** Communication partners.
- **Purposes of processing:** Communication.
- **Retention and erasure:** Deletion in accordance with the information in section [General information on data storage and deletion](#m12).
- **Legal bases:** Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR); contract fulfillment and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR). Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).

## Presence in social networks (social media) {#m136}

I maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in this context in order to communicate with the users active there or to offer information about me.

I would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This may result in risks for users because, for example, it could make it more difficult to enforce users' rights.

Furthermore, user data is generally processed within social networks for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user profiles can be created based on user behavior and the resulting interests of users. The user profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the networks that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are generally stored on the user's computer, in which the user's usage behavior and interests are stored. Furthermore, data can also be stored in the user profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them).

For a detailed description of the respective forms of processing and the possibilities of objection (opt-out), please refer to the data protection declarations and information provided by the operators of the respective networks.

In the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights, I would also like to point out that these can be asserted most effectively with the providers. Only the providers have access to the users' data and can take appropriate measures and provide information directly. If you still need help, you can contact me.

- **Types of data processed:** Contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers); content data (e.g. text or image messages and contributions as well as the information relating to them, such as information on authorship or time of creation). Usage data (e.g. page views and dwell time, click paths, usage intensity and frequency, device types and operating systems used, interactions with content and functions).
- **Data subjects:** Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
- **Purposes of processing:** Contact requests and communication; feedback (e.g. collecting feedback via online form); marketing.
- **Retention and erasure:** Deletion in accordance with the information in section [General information on data storage and deletion](#m12).
- **Legal bases:** Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).

I have concluded a special agreement with Facebook (“Information on Page Insights”, <https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum>), which regulates in particular which security measures Facebook must observe and in which Facebook has agreed to fulfill the rights of data subjects (i.e. users can, for example, send information or deletion requests directly to Facebook). The rights of users (in particular to information, deletion, objection and complaint to the competent supervisory authority) are not restricted by the agreements with Facebook. Further information can be found in the “Information on Page Insights” (<https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information_about_page_insights_data>). The joint responsibility is limited to the collection by and transfer of data to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, a company based in the EU.

## Plugins and embedded functions and content {#m328}

I incorporate functional and content elements into my online offering that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as “third-party providers”). These may be, for example, graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as “content”).

The integration always requires that the third-party providers of this content process the IP address of the user, as they would not be able to send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required to display this content or function. I endeavor to only use content whose respective providers only use the IP address to deliver the content. Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as “web beacons”) for statistical or marketing purposes. Pixel tags can be used to analyze information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of visit and other information about the use of my online offer, as well as being linked to such information from other sources.

- **Purposes of processing:** Provision of my online offer and user-friendliness.
- **Legal bases:** Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).

## Definitions {#m42}

This section provides you with an overview of the terms used in this privacy policy. Many of the terms are taken from the law and are defined above all in Art. 4 GDPR. The legal definitions are binding. The following explanations, on the other hand, are primarily intended to aid understanding. The terms are listed in alphabetical order.

- **Contact data:** Contact data is essential information that enables communication with individuals or organizations. It includes telephone numbers, postal addresses and email addresses, as well as communication tools such as social media handles and instant messaging identifiers.
Meta, communication and procedural data: Meta data, communication data and procedural data are categories that contain information about how data is processed, transmitted and managed. Meta data, also known as data about data, includes information that describes the context, origin and structure of other data. It can include information on file size, creation date, the author of a document and change histories. Communication data records the exchange of information between users via various channels, such as e-mail traffic, call logs, messages in social networks and chat histories, including the persons involved, time stamps and transmission paths. Procedural data describes the processes and procedures within systems or organizations, including workflow documentation, logs of transactions and activities, and audit logs used to track and review operations.
- **Content data:** Content data includes information generated in the course of creating, editing and publishing content of all kinds. This category of data can include text, images, videos, audio files and other multimedia content published on various platforms and media. Content data is not limited to the actual content, but also includes metadata that provides information about the content itself, such as tags, descriptions, author information and publication dates
- **Contract data:** Contract data is specific information that relates to the formalization of an agreement between two or more parties. It documents the conditions under which services or products are provided, exchanged or sold. This category of data is essential for the management and fulfillment of contractual obligations and includes both the identification of the contracting parties and the specific terms and conditions of the agreement. Contract data may include start and end dates of the contract, the type of services or products agreed, price agreements, payment terms, termination rights, renewal options and special terms or clauses. They serve as the legal basis for the relationship between the parties and are crucial for the clarification of rights and obligations, the enforcement of claims and the resolution of disputes.
- **Inventory data:** Inventory data includes essential information that is necessary for the identification and administration of contractual partners, user accounts, profiles and similar assignments. This data may include personal and demographic information such as names, contact information (addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses), dates of birth and specific identifiers (user IDs). Inventory data forms the basis for any formal interaction between individuals and services, facilities or systems by enabling unique assignment and communication.
- **Log data:** Log data is information about events or activities logged on a system or network. This data typically contains information such as timestamps, IP addresses, user actions, error messages and other details about the use or operation of a system. Log data is often used to analyze system problems, for security monitoring or to create performance reports.
- **Payment data:** Payment data includes all information needed to process payment transactions between buyers and sellers. This data is crucial for e-commerce, online banking and any other form of financial transaction. It includes details such as credit card numbers, bank details, payment amounts, transaction dates, verification numbers and billing information. Payment data can also include information about payment status, chargebacks, authorizations and fees. 
- **Personal data:** “Personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter “data subject”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier (e.g. cookie) or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
- **Processing:** Any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means. The term is broad and covers practically every handling of data, be it collection, evaluation, storage, transmission or deletion.
- **Reach measurement:** Reach measurement (also known as web analytics) is used to evaluate the flow of visitors to an online offering and can include the behavior of visitors or their interest in certain information, such as website content. With the help of reach analysis, website operators can, for example, see at what time visitors visit their website and what content they are interested in. This allows them, for example, to better adapt the content of the website to the needs of their visitors. Pseudonymous cookies and web beacons are often used for reach analysis in order to recognize returning visitors and thus obtain more precise analyses of the use of an online offering.
- **Responsible Person:** The natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
- **Server monitoring and error detection:** With the help of server monitoring and error detection, I ensure the availability and integrity of my online offer and use the processed data for the technical optimization of my online offer. Performance, load and comparable technical values are processed to provide information about the stability and any anomalies of my online offering. In the event of errors and anomalies, individual inquiries from users of my online offering are recorded in order to identify and rectify sources of problems.
- **Usage data:** Usage data refers to information that captures how users interact with digital products, services or platforms. This data includes a wide range of information that shows how users use applications, which functions they prefer, how long they stay on certain pages and which paths they navigate through an application. Usage data can also include frequency of use, timestamps of activities, IP addresses, device information and location data. It is particularly valuable for analysing user behaviour, optimizing user experiences, personalizing content and improving products or services. In addition, usage data plays a crucial role in identifying trends, preferences and potential problem areas within digital offerings.
