After some problems with the old web server I took the opportunity to overhaul my personal website.
Here it is, a basic portfolio of my activities with and around computers and IT, mostly.
With a bit simpler backend, it will be completed step by step with links to the diverse projects I pursue.

Thanks for your attention & have fun browsing!
